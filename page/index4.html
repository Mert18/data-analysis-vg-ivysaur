        <h2>Regression</h2>
        <p>Regression is basically predicting a target value by using independent predictors. We use regression to find a relationship between our values.</p>
        <p>Linear Regression: Shows the linear relationship between independent value and the dependent value(in this example, region sales and global sales).</p>
        <p>Random Forest Regression: simply combines multiple decision trees and tries to find the output based on average of these decision trees.</p>
        <p>Ridge Regression: Is one of the advanced versions of linear regression, it is better for long term predictions.</p>

        </div>

        <p>R-squared is a statistical measure of how close the data are to the fitted regression line.</p>
        <p>For different regression models, we can see the accuracy and r2 scores above.</p>

        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>In this analysis, we have inspected the video game sales by Genres, Sales,Platforms and also Regions. There are explicit outcomes.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>We saw that Nintendo and Wii has a great market for video games. Also Playstation is pretty consistent in this matter.</p>
        <br>
        <p>North Americans and Europeans have a similar taste about games. But when it comes the platforms, Wii is a good choice for both, on the other hand, Nintendo is not adequate for Europe. Japan likes Wii and Nintendo, but GB(Game Boy) is the favourite in there.</p>
        <br>
        <p>
            North America and Global Sales are dependent, so there is a big gaming community, also Europe almost controls the industry.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Action games are loved by people and this genre is continuously successful in this industry. Role playing games are in increase and Strategy games have their community.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Using these datas and graphs, we could have many more outcomes.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        So in 2021, when it comes to games, it has a great potential. New AAA games have a great community waiting for them. People are waiting 9 years just for a games. As the world changes, many industries be effected by this change. But there is one industry that never will be effected by any kind of threat, virus or whatsoever, Game Industry.
