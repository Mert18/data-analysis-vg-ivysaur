        <h2>Regression</h2>
        <p>Regression is basically predicting a target value by using independent predictors. We use regression to find
            a relationship between our values.</p>
        
        <p><span>Important Note: Regressions are taken as Regional Sales versus Global Sales. So all of the tests below are made with Global Sales numbers.</span></p>

        <h3 class="regtitle">Linear Regression </h3>
        <p>Shows the linear relationship between independent value and the dependent value(in this
            example, region sales and global sales).</p>

        <h3 class="regtitle">Random Forest Regression</h3>
        <p>Simply combines multiple decision trees and tries to find the output based on

        <h3 class="regtitle">Ridge Regression</h3>
        <p>Is one of the advanced versions of linear regression, it is better for long term
            predictions.</p>

        <p>R-squared is a statistical measure of how close the data are to the fitted regression line.</p>
        <p>For different regression models, we can see the accuracy and r2 scores above.</p>

        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>In this analysis, we have inspected the video game sales by Genres, Sales,Platforms and also Regions. There
            are explicit outcomes.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>We saw that Nintendo and Wii has a great market for video games. Also Playstation is pretty consistent in
            this matter.</p>
        <br>
        <p>North Americans and Europeans have a similar taste about games. But when it comes the platforms, Wii is a
            good choice for both, on the other hand, Nintendo is not adequate for Europe. Japan likes Wii and Nintendo,
            but GB(Game Boy) is the favourite in there.</p>
        <br>
        <p>
            North America and Global Sales are dependent, so there is a big gaming community, also Europe almost
            controls the industry.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Action games are loved by people and this genre is continuously successful in this industry. Role playing
            games are in increase and Strategy games have their community.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Using these datas and graphs, we could have many more outcomes.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        So in 2021, when it comes to games, it has a great potential. New AAA games have a great community waiting for
        them. People are waiting 9 years just for a games. As the world changes, many industries be effected by this
        change. But there is one industry that never will be effected by any kind of threat, virus or whatsoever, Game
        Industry.
