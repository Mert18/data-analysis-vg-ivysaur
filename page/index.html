                <p>It is obvious that video games have been a big part of our lives since they began appearing. Video
                    games
                    are somewhere we find friends, we spend our leisure times and a huge part of <a

                        target="_blank">escape culture.</a> </p>
                <br>
                <p>Novadays, not just children but adults also love playing games. Since parents realized the safety of
                    streets that they had grown is now questionable, they prefer their children to stay at home and do
                    whatever they do. Escaping this problems and many other made the gaming community bigger and more
                    heteregenous.</p>

                <h2>About the dataset</h2>
                <br>
                <p>This dataset we found on kaggle consists more than 15000 record of games between 1980 and 2016.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Dataset includes 11 different property of these games which are:</p>
                <p>Rank, Name, Platform, Year, Genre, Publisher, NA_Sales, EU_Sales, JP_Sales, Other_Sales, Global_Sales
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>As you can see, dataset holds important records that we can work on and find solutions to big
                    problems.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Our Goal</h3>
                <p>There are numerous goals for us to find out in this dataset. We can list them roughly as:</p>
                <br>
                <p>1- Finding investment solutions to big companies as finding the value of games in different parts of
                    the world.</p>
                <p>2- Analyzing North America, Europe, Japan,Global and figuring out what kind of genres they like
                    or hate.</p>
                <p>3- We will witness the rise of the game industry and be pointing out the importance in entertainment
                    industry.</p>
                <p>Besides, as you will see, we will derive numereous other solutions to certain problems as we move.

            <h2>Explotary Data Analysis</h2>
            <br>
            <p>As we stated before, our dataset records have 11 different properties and we want to have closer look at
                them here.</p>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Rank: int64</li>
                <li>Name: object</li>
                <li>Platform: object</li>
                <li>Year: float64</li>
                <li>Genre: object</li>
                <li>Publisher: object</li>
                <li>NA_Sales: float64</li>
                <li>EU_Sales: float64</li>
                <li>JP_Sales: float64</li>
                <li>Other_Sales: float64</li>
                <li>Global_Sales: float64</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>Our dataset had 16598 records but for numerous reasons, we had to do some data cleaning swiping out the
                records that can destroy our analysis. At the end of the day, we will be inspecting 16291 records and 11
                different property of them.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Beginning of our explotary data analysis, it would be really cool if we could have a correlation map.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Correlation between properties</h4>

                    <img id="cor" src="assets/corr.png" alt="correlation map" />
                </div>
                <div class="right">
                    <p>Inspecting this table, we can derive that NA_Sales and EU_Sales has a significant effect on
                        Global_Sales.
                        Also these two region has an impact on each other so we cannot ignore this close relationship.
