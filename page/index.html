                <br>
                <p>Novadays, not just children but adults also love playing games. Since parents realized the safety of
                    streets that they had grown is now questionable, they prefer their children to stay at home and do
                    whatever they do. Escaping this problems and many other made the gaming community bigger and more

            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <br>
            <p>As we stated before, our dataset records have 11 different properties and we want to have closer look at
                them here.</p>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Rank: int64</li>
                <li>Name: object</li>
                <li>Platform: object</li>
                <li>Year: float64</li>
                <li>Genre: object</li>
                <li>Publisher: object</li>
                <li>NA_Sales: float64</li>
                <li>EU_Sales: float64</li>
                <li>JP_Sales: float64</li>
                <li>Other_Sales: float64</li>
                <li>Global_Sales: float64</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>Our dataset had 16598 records but for numerous reasons, we had to do some data cleaning swiping out the
                records that can destroy our analysis. At the end of the day, we will be inspecting 16291 records and 11
                different property of them.</p>
